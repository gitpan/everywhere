NAME
    everywhere - Use a module (or feature) everywhere

SYNOPSIS
      #!/usr/bin/perl

      use strict;
      use everywhere qw/ feature say /;
      use Greet;

      Greet::hello();

      # in Greet.pm
      package Greet;
      use strict;
      sub hello {
        say "Helloooooo!!!!";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    I got tired of putting "use 5.010" at the top of every module. So now I
    can throw this in my toplevel program and not have to Repeat Myself
    elsewhere.

    In theory you should be able to pass it whatever you pass to use.

    Also, I just made it so you can do:

      use everywhere 'MooseX::Declare',
        matching => '^MyApp',
        use_here => 0;

    for example and then it will only apply this module to things matching
    your regex. And not use it here. You can also throw in 'package_level =>
    1' to use your package after every "package ..." line. All these are
    experimental :)

BUGS
    Currently you can only use this once.

    Also look at use and feature.
